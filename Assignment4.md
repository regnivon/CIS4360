I utilized an EC2 instance to write and run a simple python script which totals the numbers from 0 to the number a user passes in through the command line. To do this, I needed to install python3 in the instance, which utilized the yum package manager provided by Amazon linux. I have used AWS resources several times before, and I enjoy having cloud resources as a sandbox and as a deployment environment for class projects. It is nice to have an environment that can be set up exactly as you need with no bloat and no limitations, and that can be started and stopped at any time.  


Cloud computing is a massive enabler for microservice architecture. One of the core benefits claimed by microservice architecture is scalability. Individual microservices are built to be able to be independently scaled. Cloud resources make this much easier. In the past, to scale up a resource a company would need to purchase additional servers and would need to manage them in house. This creates a few issues. Firstly, the company may want to buy enough compute for their max capacity, but this would lead to wasted resources during lower usage times. Secondly, the company has to manage these resources themselves, this is an additional cost and security risk. These problems are solved by cloud computing. Resources in the cloud can be scaled up and down on demand, so users will only pay for what they actually need. Additionally, hardware is managed by the cloud provider, reducing costs and effort further. This makes scalable microservices possible, when a component has a high load and needs more instances to handle it, all that needs to be done is creating more instances with that component running.  
Another way microservices are aided by cloud computing is through integration. Another key feature of microservices is the enablement of rapid CI/CD cycles. Cloud computing makes this much easier. Since cloud environments are well supported by providers, powerful APIs are provided which allow for easy deployment to the cloud. Cloud resources can be utilized as build servers for things like docker images, which can then be deployed in an automated manner to cloud servers. This is made even easier by tools like kubernetes, which abstract the deployment enviroment further from the user.
