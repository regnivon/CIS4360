I would like to do my final presentation on Option #19: Implementation of Istio.    
Kubernetes has been a really cool tool to use in my experience, and I have been able to use some of the additional tools people place on clusters to add more features. I have used Istio in the past, but my usage only really scratched the surface of Istio, and I would love to do a deeper dive.
Istio is a really interesting tool and has a lot of features that make the management of a complex architecture much easier. I would like to understand how Istio
manages both of the forms of traffic that it can be configured to control, traffic that is inbound/outbound to the cluster and traffic that is internal in the 
cluster between the individual services. I would also like to understand better some of the security features Istio provides, such as authorization and
authentication. I would like to further understand what makes Istio or another service mesh a necessary component of a kubernetes cluster that a microservice
architecture is run upon. Finally, I would like to know more about how Istio is used in production environments, including some of the best practices.
