# Assignment 1: Innovation Insight for Microservices Commentary

I think that one of the most interesting aspects of this analysis by Gartner are the firm recommendations made which assert that microservice adoption is not the best choice for many organizations. I also think that the discussion of miniservices as a viable alternative to bridge the gap between monolithic applications and microservice based ones is quite compelling. From my personal experience, I am inclined to agree. It is much, much easier to construct an application from multiple miniservices than through microservices. Miniservices still retain a large amount of the value add from microservice architecture as they allow for increased agility, smaller development teams, and rapid CI/CD capabilities.  
One of the key insights of the article I think is the value of team independence. Teams should not need to wait for the results of other teams in order to deploy their new features. Features should be as independent as possible such that they can be continuously delivered even at the pace of several times a day to keep up in a competitive business environment. This increases agility, but additionally makes mistakes less impactful. Mistakes in code are mitigated, for example as each microservice maintains its own state data (should it be needed), obscure race conditions are not possible. Additionally, should a regression be shipped in a single microservice, its impact should be quite limited to the feature provided by the microservice.  
I think part of the difficulty of microservice adoption is thinking at the single feature level. When I think of a single feature, the "checkout" feature of an e-commerce application would be an example to me. However, the Gartner report notes that actually, this single "feature" would be split into several microservices. Thus, the level of granularity is much greater than most people are used to. I also think the idea of having a private API to enable a given feature is quite hard to conceptualize. It is difficult to see how one would access a feature behind a private API, but in fact having private APIs is a key enabler to microservice architecture, as it greatly reduces dependencies, increasing feature and team independence.  
The technology involved in MSA is an interesting aspect from a software engineering perspective. There are a wide range of tools utilized, like containers, Kubernetes and service meshes like Istio that allow for greatly increased agility and CI/CD capabilities. Additionally, this infrastructure enables the architecture described in the report, with independent microservices behind private APIs held together with a service mesh like Istio.
